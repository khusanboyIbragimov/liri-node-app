# liri-node-app


### Overview

In this assignment, I made LIRI. LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a _Language_ Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.



1. LIRI will display my latest tweets. 

2. In this app I used the Twitter, Spotify and OMDB APIs. 

   * [Twitter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/twitter)
   
   * [Node-Spotify-API](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-spotify-api)
   
   * [Request](https://www.npmjs.com/package/request)

     * You'll use Request to grab data from the [OMDB API](http://www.omdbapi.com).

   * [DotEnv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv)
     
### Instructions

     * The song's name
